Please edit the following files where specified:

banQuery.py, banRefresh.py, insert.py
	edit the database config information
	edit the to and from email addresses(where applicable)

database.conf
	set actionban = <path to insert.py>

jail.local
	this is just an example file of the jail.local that shows
	how to implement the actions in your existing jail.local file

sendmail-common.conf
	set the sender flag or use your existing file with same name

sendmail-logan.conf
	set the dest flag

start-stop-email.conf
	no changes necessary

HOW TO IMPLEMENT:

create the database user and run the create table script against the database
(initial.sql)

place the *.conf files in your /etc/fail2ban/actions.d/ directory

update your jail.local

run banQuery on a once daily cronjob
(not: this must be on sudo crontab -e)
(00 9 * * * python /scripts/fail2ban/banQuery.py)

This should do it. Instructions will be updated once I have a chance to 
implement these as test
